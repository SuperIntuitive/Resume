## Summary
A self-taught, self-starter programmer, I wrote my first program in C over twenty years ago. I am comfortable working as an individual contributor or as a member of a broader team. Particular emphasis on C#, PHP, JavaScript, AJAX. I can take direction and run with it and quickly and easily prototype or construct any web based front-end with real-time SQL data support along with the corresponding back-end systems. I create automation programs to allow for easy interfaces into several business systems including Salesforce, Marketo, Dynamics CRM. I can work with any API to create links between many different systems.
